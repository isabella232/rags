# Rags

Derived from the robot dog from the Woody Allen movie Sleeper, Rags follows our conversations on HipChat and provides us with some ambient awareness. Also, humor.

Additional thanks to the [Los Angeles Times Data Desk](http://datadesk.latimes.com/) and their [copyboy project](https://github.com/datadesk/copyboy).

## Some light reading
* [The hubot official docs](http://hubot.github.com/)
* [hubot-hipchat](https://github.com/hipchat/hubot-hipchat)
* [More hubot scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts)

## Local development
1. Create a [new HipChat account](https://www.hipchat.com/help/page/how-do-i-invite-other-users/) for your bot to use. Stay signed in to the account - we'll need to access its account settings later.

1. Make sure native dependencies are installed:

        (e.g. OS X with brew)
        % brew install icu4c
        % brew link icu4c

        (e.g. Linux with apt-get)
        % apt-get install libexpat1-dev
        % apt-get install libicu-dev

1. Install `hubot` from npm, if you don't already have it:

        % npm install --global hubot

1. Switch to the new `hubot` directory:

        % cd <above path>

1. Install `hubot` dependencies:

        % npm install

1. Export the proper environment variables. Talk to Jeremy or Chris about these values.
```
export HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID=1111_2222@chat.hipchat.com
export HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD=password
export HUBOT_HIPCHAT_ROOMS=1111_name@conf.hipchat.com
export HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## Deployment
1. Make sure you've exported prefixed versions of our environment variables like so:
```
export RAGS_HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID=1111_2222@chat.hipchat.com
export RAGS_HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD=password
export RAGS_HUBOT_HIPCHAT_ROOMS=1111_name@conf.hipchat.com
export RAGS_HUBOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

1. Add your new scripts to the repository and send them along.
```
fab production master deploy
```

We don't have a staging environment yet.
